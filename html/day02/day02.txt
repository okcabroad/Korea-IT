                            resources need to build the website 

client --------> action -----------> backend server 


Sure, here's a summarized version in bullet points:

- **Client Initialization**:
  - Client triggers an action (e.g., clicking a link, submitting a form).

- **Formulation of the Request**:
  - Client creates an HTTP request.
  - Includes HTTP method, URL, headers, and optionally a request body.

- **Transmission of the Request**:
  - Client sends the request over the network to the frontend server.

- **Frontend Server Processing**:
  - Server receives and processes the request.
  - Routes to appropriate handler/controller.
  - Parses headers and body.
  - Authenticates the client if required.
  - Executes business logic or preprocessing.

- **Interaction with Backend Services (Optional)**:
  - Frontend server may interact with backend services on behalf of the client.

- **Generation of Response**:
  - Frontend server creates an HTTP response.
  - Includes status code, headers, and optionally a response body.

- **Transmission of the Response**:
  - Server sends the response back to the client over the network.

- **Client Processing**:
  - Client receives and processes the response.
  - Renders HTML content, parses JSON data, or handles binary files.

This process enables communication between the client and the frontend server via HTTP, facilitating interaction with the application or service provided by the server.
