Sematic Web dev 

Semantic HTML, also known as semantic markup, refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning—or semantics—of the content contained within them.

By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps define the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page.
    1. Accesibility 
        e.g. screen readers for visually impaired people 
    2. SEO (Search engine optimization)

(As opposed to non-semantic HTML, which uses tags that don’t directly convey meaning.)
