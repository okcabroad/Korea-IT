    Methd Attribute: 

    GET: The GET method appends the form data to the URL specified 
    in the action attribute and sends it to the server as part of 
    the URL query string. This method is typically used when the 
    form submission does not involve sensitive information and when 
    you want the form data to be visible in the URL.

    request body, separate from the URL. This method is commonly 
    used when submitting sensitive information, large amounts of 
    data, or when you don't want the form data to be visible in the URL.
